Agents_demo = "An Agent category paper's abstract is as follow: Argument in Multi-Agent Systems Multi-agent systems research is concerned both with the modelling of human and animal societies and with the development of principles for the design of practical distributed information management systems. This position paper will, rather than examine the various dierences in perspective within this area of research, discuss issues of communication and commitment that are of interest to multi-agent systems research in general. 1 Introduction A computational society is a collection of autonomous agents that are loosely dependent upon each other. The intentional stance [12] is often taken in describing the state of these agents. An agent may have beliefs, desires, intentions, and it may adopt a role or have relationships with others. Thus, multi-agent systems (MAS) as with most AI research is signi cantly inuenced, at least in its vocabulary, by philosophy and cognitive psychology. 1 So, what's the point? Computational societies are developed for two primary reasons:  Mode..."
Machine_Learning_demo = "A Machine Learning category paper's abstract is as follow: Decomposition in Data Mining: An Industrial Case Study Data mining offers tools for discovery of relationships, patterns, and knowledge in large databases. The knowledge extraction process is computationally complex and therefore a subset of all data is normally considered for mining. In this paper, numerous methods for decomposition of data sets are discussed. Decomposition enhances the quality of knowledge extracted from large databases by simplification of the data mining task. The ideas presented are illustrated with examples and an industrial case study. In the case study reported in this paper, a data mining approach is applied to extract knowledge from a data set. The extracted knowledge is used for the prediction and prevention of manufacturing faults in wafers."

The context available to a topic driven crawler allows for informed decisions about how to prioritize the links to be explored, given time and bandwidth constraints. We have developed a framework and a number of methods to evaluate the performance of topic driven crawler algorithms in a fair way, under limited memory resources. Quality metrics are derived from lexical features, link analysis, and a hybrid combination of the two. In this paper we focus on the issue of how greedy a crawler should be. Given noisy quality estimates of links in a frontier, we investigate what is an appropriate balance between a crawler's need to exploit this information to focus on the most promising links, and the need to explore links that appear suboptimal but might lead to more relevant pages. We show that exploration is essential to locate the most relevant pages under a number of quality measures, in spite of a penalty in the early stage of the crawl."
Databases_demo = "A Databases paper's abstract is as follow: Optimal External Memory Interval Management  In this paper we present the external interval tree, an optimal external memory data structure for answering stabbing queries on a set of dynamically maintained intervals. The external interval tree can be used in an optimal solution to the dynamic interval management problem, which is a central problem for object-oriented and temporal databases and for constraint logic programming. Part of the structure uses a weight-balancing technique for efficient worst-case manipulation of balanced trees, which is of independent interest. The external interval tree, as well as our new balancing technique, have recently been used to develop several efficient external data structures."

RoboCup-Rescue intends to promote research and development in this socially significant domain by creating a standard simulator and forum for researchers and practitioners. While the rescue domain intuitively appealing as large scale multi-agent domains, it has not yet given through analysis on its domain characteristics. In this paper, we present detailed analysis on the task domain and elucidate characteristics necessary for multi-agent systems for this domain.  1 Introduction  In this paper, we propose RoboCup-Rescue, as a secondary domain for RoboCup activities [ Kitano, et al., 1997]. The aim of RoboCup-Rescue are (1) to ensure smooth transfer of technologies invented through RoboCup activity to a socially significant real world domain, (2) to establish a domain which complements features that are missing in soccer, and (3) to examine funderm..."
Artificial_Intelligence_demo = "An Artifical Intelligence category paper's abstract is as follow: Optimising Propositional Modal Satisfiability for Description Logic Subsumption . Effective optimisation techniques can make a dramatic difference in the performance of knowledge representation systems based on expressive description logics. Because of the correspondence between description logics and propositional modal logic many of these techniques carry over into propositional modal logic satisfiability checking. Currently-implemented representation systems that employ these techniques, such as FaCT and DLP, make effective satisfiable checkers for various propositional modal logics. 1 Introduction  Description logics are a logical formalism for the representation of knowledge about individuals and descriptions of individuals. Description logics represent and reason with descriptions similar to all people whose friends are both doctors and lawyers" or "all people whose children are doctors or lawyers or who have a child who has a spouse. The computations performed by systems that implement description logics are based around determining whether one descriptio..."
